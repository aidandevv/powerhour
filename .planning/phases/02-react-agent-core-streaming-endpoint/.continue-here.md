<current_state>
Phase 2 planning initiated via /gsd:plan-phase 2. A researcher agent was spawned and is still running in the background (agent aa3628b). It has been actively researching Vercel AI SDK v6 streamText API, Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite model ID, tool() wrapper patterns, and streaming route setup. The 02-RESEARCH.md file has NOT been written yet — the researcher is still gathering data. No plans have been created.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Phase 2 directory created: .planning/phases/02-react-agent-core-streaming-endpoint/
- plan-phase workflow initialized (steps 1-5 in progress)
- Phase researcher spawned (agent aa3628b) — actively running, has done ~90 tool calls
- Researcher has gathered data on: streamText parameters, google provider config, gemini-2.5-flash-lite model ID, AI SDK 6 changes
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Researcher agent may or may not finish writing 02-RESEARCH.md before session ends
- If research file exists on resume: continue plan-phase from step 6 (spawn planner)
- If research file missing: re-run /gsd:plan-phase 2 (will redo research)
- Spawn gsd-planner to create 02-01-PLAN.md and 02-02-PLAN.md
- Spawn gsd-plan-checker to verify plans
- Execute Phase 2 plans
- Then Phase 3 (Chat Widget UI) and Phase 4 (PDF Reports)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- No new decisions this session — still in research phase
- All prior decisions from Phase 1 carry forward (see STATE.md Accumulated Context)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None — researcher was running normally when paused

<context>
User wants to finish the entire agentic feature implementation (Phases 2-4). We started with /gsd:plan-phase 2 and are at the research step. The researcher agent is actively fetching AI SDK v6 docs. The simplest resume path is /gsd:plan-phase 2 which will detect existing research if written, or re-research if not.
</context>

<next_action>
Run /gsd:plan-phase 2 — it will auto-detect existing research and continue from planning step. If 02-RESEARCH.md exists, it skips research. If not, it re-runs research. After planning, run /gsd:execute-phase 2, then repeat plan+execute for phases 3 and 4.
